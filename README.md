### Why And How (Tour of this Web-site)?

**1. Programming Hero (An online School of Programming world) has provided me an assignment to make an Quiz Website for Front-End Web-Developers.**
 
**2. They Guided me through how the website should work.**
 
**3. First, I have Created an environment for this `Single Page Application` Website by using- npm-React.**
 
**4. Then I selected a theme from DaisyUI theme Generator, which is a Tailwind CSS based library.**
 
**5. For Hero Section in Homepage I have used `LottieFiles Player` which you can see in a link provided above.**
 
**6. By using Dynamic Route from `React Router` I have made this Application super-fast.**
 
**7. `Toastify` is another beautiful React toast library used in this website, with this you can show next level notifications in your website- Alerts!**
 
**8. I have made this website super responsive by the Power of `TailwindCSS` Framework and `DaisyUI` library.**
 
**9. For showing `Dynamic link` and `pages` I have used `loader` & `useLoader` in components along with dynamic link format using `{params}` and `/:id`.**
 
**10. And `Context API` has made it easier for me to pass the data down to the deepest child element, super duper helpful.**
